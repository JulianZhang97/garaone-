Welcome to GaraOne!

This is a simplified vehicle simulation program, allowing the user to select two vehicles, and compare their performance over a 400 meter race in real-time with accurate 0-96km/h (0-60mph) acceleration times and 400 meter times. 


Tools used for this program include PostgreSQL for the database storing the vehicle information, and JavaFX for the graphical user interface.  


Feel free to run GaraOne by following the quick setup below, or view demo images of the program in action in the demos folder.

GaraOne Setup:

1. You must have the PostgreSQL JDBC driver included (in the lib folder) set as a external JAR on the build path.  

For more details pn using the JDBC driver see this page:
https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/head/classpath.html

2. Run the main GaraOne class to start the program.
